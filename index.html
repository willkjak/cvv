  <h2>Education</h2>
  <h3><em>Ball State University</em></h3>
  <p>I attended Ball State from 2018 to 2020. I went with the intention of
    becoming a Telecommunications major with a minor or possibly a dual major
    in Japanese. However, I did not find much passion in the courses I had been
    taking and thus resigned from school and now have started my journey with
    Web Development. </p>
